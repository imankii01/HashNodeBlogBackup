# HashNode Blog Backup

This repository serves as a backup for all blogs published on [My Hashnode Blog](https://imankit.hashnode.dev/?source=top_nav_blog_home). It ensures that the content is securely stored and readily available for reference, archiving, or migration purposes.

---

## Purpose

Maintaining a backup of your blogs is crucial for:
- Preserving content in case of platform outages or changes.
- Easy migration to other platforms if required.
- Local reference for editing or sharing.
- Version control for blog updates.

---

## Blog Topics

Here are some topics you will find in the blogs:
- **MERN Stack Development**: Tutorials, best practices, and project guides.
- **AWS for Beginners**: Step-by-step instructions to get started with AWS services.
- **Web Development**: Tips, tricks, and insights into modern web development practices.
- **Personal Experiences**: Lessons learned as a developer and a learner.

---

## How This Backup Works

- Each blog post is stored as a Markdown file with appropriate metadata (e.g., title, date, tags).
- Images and media used in the blogs are stored in a separate directory for easy access.
- The repository is structured for readability and version control.
