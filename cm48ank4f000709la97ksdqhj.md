![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733220220716/30abbcee-3eb9-4d7a-8872-9739f9551c34.png align="center")

EC2 is **AWS's cloud computing service** that allows you to run virtual servers (called **instances**) in the cloud. It's the most flexible and popular service in AWS because it lets you run applications without managing physical hardware. Whether you're hosting a website, running complex simulations, or processing large datasets, EC2 is at the heart of it all.

### **What Does EC2 Do?**

* **Virtual Servers (Instances)**: EC2 allows you to rent virtual servers (also known as **instances**) to run applications and websites.
    
* **Scalability**: You can scale your compute resources up or down depending on the workload. This is especially useful for handling traffic spikes or reducing costs during idle periods.
    
* **Elasticity**: EC2 can automatically scale resources with **Auto Scaling** based on traffic or performance needs.
    
* **Flexible Pricing**: EC2 offers several pricing models (On-demand, Reserved, Spot Instances) to fit different needs and budgets.
    

### **How to Use EC2: Step-by-Step**

#### 1\. **Sign in to AWS Console**

* Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your credentials.
    

#### 2\. **Launch an EC2 Instance**

* Go to the **EC2** service.
    
* Click on **Launch Instance** to begin the process of setting up your virtual machine (VM).
    
* **Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**: Select an OS image (Linux, Ubuntu, Windows, etc.). This is your base environment.
    
* **Select an Instance Type**: Choose an instance type based on your application‚Äôs needs. The **t2.micro** type is ideal for small, low-cost instances, perfect for testing.
    
* **Configure Instance Details**: Set up your instance with network settings, IAM roles, and user data scripts.
    
* **Add Storage**: Choose how much storage you need. For web apps, 8 GB may suffice, but for databases or media storage, you may need more.
    
* **Configure Security Groups**: Create or select a security group that defines the rules for inbound and outbound traffic. For example, allow HTTP (port 80) for a web server.
    
* **Review and Launch**: Check all settings and then click **Launch** to deploy the instance.
    
* **Connect to Your Instance**: Once your EC2 instance is running, use SSH for Linux instances or RDP for Windows to log into your instance.
    

### **Use Cases for EC2**

* **Web Hosting**: Host dynamic websites or applications.
    
* **Data Processing**: Use EC2 for computational tasks, like data analysis, simulations, or machine learning.

#### 3\. **Upload Files**

* After the bucket is created, click on the bucket name and then click **Upload** to add files.
    
* Select files from your local system and choose to either upload them directly or create folders to organize them.
    

#### 4\. **Set Permissions and Access Control**

* Define who can access your files. Use IAM roles and policies to restrict access to certain users or services.
    
* Enable **Versioning** to keep track of different versions of files.
    

#### 5\. **Manage Your Data**

* Set **Lifecycle Policies** to automate the management of files (e.g., automatically delete old versions of files or move files to cheaper storage classes after a set period).
    
* Use **Presigned URLs** to grant temporary access to files for specific users or applications.
    

### **Use Cases for S3**
