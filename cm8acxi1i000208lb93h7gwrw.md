## Introduction

I discovered ngrok while trying to solve a frustrating problem: testing webhooks locally. I was working on a payment integration, and each change required deploying my code just to test the webhooks — a slow and repetitive process. Then a colleague told me about ngrok, and it changed everything.

Ngrok creates a secure tunnel from your local machine to the internet, giving you a public URL for your local development server. In simple terms, it makes your local project accessible from anywhere, instantly.

## Why Ngrok Changed My Development Game

Before ngrok, my workflow felt clunky. Testing on different devices meant deploying every small change to a staging server. Sharing work-in-progress with clients required temporary servers. Debugging webhooks was especially painful.

Ngrok simplified all of this. With just one command, I could:

* Test apps on any device instantly.
    
* Share projects with clients without deploying.
    
* Debug webhooks in real-time.
    
* Collaborate easily with team members.
    
* Test access from different regions without extra setup.
    

## Getting Started with Ngrok

Getting started is super simple:

1. **Install ngrok:**
    
    * On Mac:
        
        ```javascript
        brew install ngrok
        ```
        
    * On Win[dows:  
        Dow](https://ngrok.com)nload from [ngrok.com](http://ngrok.com) and install.
        

2. Sign up for a free account at [ngrok.com](http://ngrok.com) and get your auth toke[n](https://ngrok.com)
    
3. [Conf](https://ngrok.com)igure your auth token:
    
    ```bash
    ngrok config add-authtoken your_auth_token_here
    ```
    
4. Start sharing your local server (assuming it runs on port 3000):
    
    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    ```
    

### Advanced Configuration Options

You can enhance your ngrok setup with these powerful options:

1. Custom [subdomain](https://ngrok.com) (requires paid plan):
    
    ```bash
    ngrok http --subdomain=myapp 3000
    ```
    
2. [Mult](https://ngrok.com)iple ports:
    
    ```bash
    ngrok http 80,443
    ```
    
3. [Basi](https://ngrok.com)c authentication:
    
    ```bash
    ngrok http --auth="username:password" 3000
    ```
    
4. Custom r[egion:](https://ngrok.com)
    
    ```bash
    ngrok http --region=eu 3000
    ```
